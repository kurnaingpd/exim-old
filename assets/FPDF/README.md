# FPDF
## What is FPDF?
FPDF is a PHP class which allows to generate PDF files with pure PHP, that is to say without using the PDFlib library. F from FPDF stands for Free: you may use it for any kind of usage and modify it to suit your needs.

FPDF has other advantages: high level functions. Here is a list of its main features:

- Choice of measure unit, page format and margins
- Page header and footer management
- Automatic page break
- Automatic line break and text justification
- Image support (JPEG, PNG and GIF)
- Colors
- Links
- TrueType, Type1 and encoding support
- Page compression

FPDF requires no extension (except Zlib to enable compression and GD for GIF support). The latest version requires at least PHP 5.1.

The [tutorials](http://fpdf.org/en/tutorial/index.php) will give you a quick start. The complete online documentation is [here](http://fpdf.org/en/doc/index.php) and download area is [there](http://fpdf.org/en/download.php). It is strongly advised to read the [FAQ](http://fpdf.org/en/FAQ.php) which lists the most common questions and issues.

A [script](http://fpdf.org/en/script/index.php) section is available and provides some useful extensions (such as bookmarks, rotations, tables, barcodes...).

## What languages can I use?
The class can produce documents in many languages other than the Western European ones: Central European, Cyrillic, Greek, Baltic and [Thai](http://fpdf.org/en/script/script87.php), provided you own TrueType or Type1 fonts with the desired character set. [UTF-8 support](http://fpdf.org/en/script/script92.php) is also available.

## What about performance?
Of course, the generation speed of the document is less than with PDFlib. However, the performance penalty keeps very reasonable and suits in most cases, unless your documents are particularly complex or heavy.

For any remark, question or problem, you can leave a message on the [forum](http://fpdf.org/phorum/) (you don't need to register).
